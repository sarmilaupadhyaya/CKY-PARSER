CONTEXT FREE GRAMMAR

A context-free grammar (CFG) consisting of a finite set of grammar rules is a quadruple (N, T, P, S) where

N is a set of non-terminal symbols.

T is a set of terminals where N ∩ T = NULL.

P is a set of rules
P: N → (N ∪ T)*, i.e., the left-hand side of the production rule P does have any right context or left context.

S is the start symbol.
